## Naming

Every demo file must follow `{ComponentName}[.{variant}].demo.tsx`:

- `Badge.demo.tsx` — single demo for Badge component
- `Theme.typed.demo.tsx` — "typed" variant of Theme demo
- `SearchBar.multi.demo.tsx` — "multi" variant of SearchBar demo

Each component lives in its own directory: `examples/<component-name>/<Demo>.demo.tsx`.

## Content

- One demo file per component variant. Split different modes into separate files (e.g. single vs. multi).
- All text (labels, descriptions, UI strings) must be in English. No Chinese characters.
- Prefer JSX over `React.createElement`.
- Demos are single-API showcases. For multi-system stress tests, use `ink-blots/`.

## Overlays and modals

Overlays and modals must be visually floating on top of the screen, not rendered inline below it. Ink renders children in a flex column by default — without explicit positioning, overlays/modals appear as appended content at the bottom.

Every demo that uses overlays or modals must follow these rules:

1. **`fullScreen` on the provider** — `ScenarioManagementProvider` must receive `fullScreen` so the container fills the terminal viewport:
   ```tsx
   <ScenarioManagementProvider defaultScreen={Main} fullScreen>
   ```

2. **`position="absolute"` on the root Box** — the overlay/modal component's outermost Box must use Ink's absolute positioning:
   ```tsx
   <Box position="absolute" top={top} left={left} width={W} height={H} ...>
   ```

3. **Centered placement** — compute `top`/`left` from `useWindowSize()` to center the overlay/modal:
   ```tsx
   const { columns, rows } = useWindowSize();
   const top = Math.max(0, Math.floor((rows - height) / 2));
   const left = Math.max(0, Math.floor((columns - width) / 2));
   ```

4. **`backgroundColor`** — set a background color (typically `"black"`) so the floating element covers content behind it instead of rendering transparently on top.

5. **Accept `top`/`left` as props** — overlay/modal components should accept optional `top` and `left` props (following the `DevScreen` pattern), allowing callers to override the default centered placement. Use `useWindowSize()` as the fallback.

6. **Fixed dimensions** — declare `const OVERLAY_W` / `OVERLAY_H` constants at module level so the centering math is consistent.

## Imports

Import from the public API (`../../src/index.js`) or from deep component paths. Either is acceptable as long as it's consistent within the file.

## No tests in examples/

Files ending in `_test.ts(x)` do not belong in `examples/`. Tests go in `tests/`.

## Entry in README

Every new demo must be added to `examples/README.md` with its component name and run command.
